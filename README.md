Openstud_client is an unofficial client for Sapienza's Infostud.
It was written with Java 8 in mind and it supports Android 6.0+ (API Level 23+).
At the time of writing it targets Android Pie (API Level 28).

## Features
OpenStud out of the box supports every feature which was present in the old Infostud Mobile app but it comes with a new look and modern code.
The features that are supported are:
- Student authentication (as expected).
- Get student profile (first name, last name, date of birth and so on and so forth).
- Get exams done.
- Get exams doable.
- Get active reservations.
- Get available reservations.
- Compilation of the class' survey.
- Delete an active reservation.
- Get and store a receipt of an active reservation.
- Get paid/unpaid taxes.
- Show stats based on student's performance.

## What's next?
OpenStud is stable and it's perfectly working, but it's development is far from over.
A version with AndroidX (new support libraries for Android) it's in the works.
Stats can be improved by adding the option to add fake exams to simulate the changes in the GPA of the student.
Preferences activity requires some extra work to ensure that it will works in the new release of Android.

## Special thanks
Huge thanks to Leonardo Razovic for the icon and logo and to Valerio Silvestro that helped me testing the app when it was in its infancy.

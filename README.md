OpenStud is an unofficial client for Sapienza's Infostud.\
It was written with Java 8 in mind and it supports Android 6.0+ (API Level 23+), at the time of writing it targets Android Pie (API Level 28).

## Features
OpenStud out of the box supports every feature which was present in the old Infostud Mobile app but it comes with a new look and modern code.
The features that are supported are:
- Student authentication (as expected).
- Get student profile (first name, last name, date of birth and so on and so forth).
- Get passed exams.
- Get doable exams.
- Get active reservations.
- Get available reservations.
- Compilation of the class' survey.
- Delete an active reservation.
- Get and store a receipt of an active reservation.
- Get paid/unpaid taxes.
- Show stats based on student's performance.

## What's next?
OpenStud is stable and it's perfectly working, but it's development is far from over.\
A version with AndroidX (new support libraries for Android) it's in the works.\
Preferences activity requires some extra work to ensure that it will work in the new releases of Android.

## Special thanks
Huge thanks to Leonardo Razovic for the icon and logo and to Valerio Silvestro that helped me testing the app when it was in its infancy.
Last but not least, a special thanks also to Ugo Possenti who inspired me to do this app with his [Medium article](https://medium.com/@MEPoss/ora-infostud-non-fa-pi√π-schifo-21720720e556).
